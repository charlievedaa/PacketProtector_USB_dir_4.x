#  Test ruleset 
#  Version 0.3
#  Last modified 27 March, 2003
#
# These rule sets have been especially modified to test
# snort_inline.  For more information about snort_inline, 
# refer to
#
#  http://snort_inline.sf.net
#
# OPTIONS:
# drop          Drop packet and log attempt
# sdrop         Drop packet and do NOT log attempt
# reject        Drop packet, send RST, and log attempt
#               For UDP, send ICMP unreachable
#               (reject works on in IP routing mode)
# replace       Modify packet
#
# For the ability to modify attacks, you will need a different rule base,
# specifically 'replace.rules'.  This rulebase does not exist, it is 
# currently under development by the Honeynet Project.  Please send all 
# suggestions and corrections to <rules@honeynet.org>.
