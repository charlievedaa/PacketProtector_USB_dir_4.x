#  This file is similar to the "users" file.  The check items
#  are compared against the request, but the "reply" items are
#  used to update the proxied packet, not the reply to the NAS>
#
#  You can use this file to re-write requests which are about to be
#  sent to a home server.

#
#  For all proxied packets, set the User-Name in the proxied packet
#  to the Stripped-User-Name, if it exists.  If not, set it to the
#  User-Name from the original request.
